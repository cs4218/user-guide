# MERN Stack Ecommerce Project Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to our `MERN` stack ecommerce project! This project is developed using the `MERN` (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, providing a robust and scalable solution for building ecommerce websites.

## Website Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication system implemented to manage user accounts and sessions.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Seamless integration with popular payment gateways for secure and reliable online transactions.
- **Search and Filters**: Advanced search functionality and filters to help users easily find products based on their preferences.
- **Product Set**: Organized product sets for efficient navigation and browsing through various categories and collections.

## Your Task 

- **Unit and Integration Testing**: Utilize `Jest` for writing and running tests to ensure individual components and functions work as expected, finding and fixing bugs in the process.
- **UI Testing**: Utilize `Playwright` for UI testing to validate the behavior and appearance of the website's user interface.
- **Code Analysis and Coverage**: Utilize `SonarQube` for static code analysis and coverage reports to maintain code quality and identify potential issues.
- **Load Testing**: Leverage `JMeter` for load testing to assess the performance and scalability of the ecommerce platform under various traffic conditions.

We're excited to see the innovative contributions and enhancements that students will bring to this project, making it even more robust and user-friendly!

<!-- ## Project Details

Students participating in this project will have the opportunity to contribute to various aspects such as:

- Find bugs in the existing codebase and fix them to improve the overall stability and functionality of the ecommerce platform.
- Writing unit tests and UI tests to ensure the reliability and quality of the codebase.
- Analyzing code quality and coverage metrics using SonarQube and making improvements as necessary.
- Conducting load testing with JMeter to evaluate and optimize the website's performance under load. -->
