# MERN Stack Ecommerce Project Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to our MERN stack ecommerce project! This project is developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack, providing a robust and scalable solution for building ecommerce websites.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication system implemented to manage user accounts and sessions.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Seamless integration with popular payment gateways for secure and reliable online transactions.
- **Search and Filters**: Advanced search functionality and filters to help users easily find products based on their preferences.
- **Product Set**: Organized product sets for efficient navigation and browsing through various categories and collections.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Unit Testing with Jest**: Utilized Jest for writing and running unit tests to ensure individual components and functions work as expected.
- **UI Testing with Playwright**: Employed Playwright for UI testing to validate the behavior and appearance of the website's user interface.
- **Code Analysis and Coverage with SonarQube**: Utilized SonarQube for static code analysis and coverage reports to maintain code quality and identify potential issues.
- **Load Testing with JMeter**: Leveraged JMeter for load testing to assess the performance and scalability of the ecommerce platform under various traffic conditions.

## Project Extension

Students participating in this project will have the opportunity to extend functionalities and contribute to various aspects such as:

- Find bugs in the existing codebase and fix them to improve the overall stability and functionality of the ecommerce platform.
- Implementing additional features and enhancements to the ecommerce website.
- Writing unit tests and UI tests to ensure the reliability and quality of the codebase.
- Analyzing code quality and coverage metrics using SonarQube and making improvements as necessary.
- Conducting load testing with JMeter to evaluate and optimize the website's performance under load.

We're excited to see the innovative contributions and enhancements that students will bring to this project, making it even more robust and user-friendly!
